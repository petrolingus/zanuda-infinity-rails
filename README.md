# Zanuda Infinity Rails

A plugin that adds the ability to ride a Minecart indefinitely, depending on where the player looks.

In order for the Minecart to move in the right direction, you need to sit in it and turn the camera in the desired
direction. Then you need to press the `W` button.

After exiting the Minecart, the standard properties return to it - it will stop after a few meters.
